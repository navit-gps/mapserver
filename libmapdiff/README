Libmapdiff

1. Purpose: this is a special C library to create a so called
patches to apply to the binary map format used by navit.
I hope it can be used in navit itself to apply patches for maps,
since downloading updates as a full maps isn't secure (all signed,
but big blobs everytime not so good) and faster to get a patch
instead of big blobof the whole region.

2. Functions: make a difference, apply a so-called patch to binary.

3. Method: to make a proof-of-concept the first version will be
quite stupid (based on so-called 'commits'), later i'm planning
to get deeper with navit maps format and make it better.
