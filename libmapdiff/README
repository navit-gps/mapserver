Libmapdiff

1. Purpose: this is a special C library to create a so called
patches to apply to the binary map format used by navit.
I hope it can be used in navit itself to apply patches for maps,
since downloading updates as a full maps isn't secure (all signed,
but big blobs everytime not so good) and faster to get a patch
instead of big blobof the whole region.

2. Functions: make a difference, apply a so-called patch to binary.

3. Method: to make a proof-of-concept the first version will be
quite stupid (based on so-called 'commits'), later i'm planning
to get deeper with navit maps format and make it better.

3.1 Commits algo: Navit map format actually is a Zip files with a lot
of files, some of those changes, others going to be deleted, etc ...
A patch in this case might looks like the following:
  1. Complete a list of deletions
  2. Complete a list of insertions
  3. Complete a list of diffences (i.e. if files are differs)
  4. Write all lists to the patch
  5. Create a binary diffs for each files differs
  6. Write all diffs to the patch
  7. Update patch header

4. Am i idiot ?
Not known to the public yet, but this is just a quick and dirty
implementation. I need more time to inspect and investigate navit
map format, for now just have few maps with different dates and
usual tools: unzip, sed, awk, diff etc ...
From my point of view - my proposal will works (in some cases) well,
but patches for 1 year old map huge. To optimize it library must
know about index format and mostly about everything to make an optimal
patch (patch will became some kind of instructions also (guess like
rename this file, take this piece from this one and move to the other,
delete this file, apply a changes to this file, etc...)) - it makes
a mapdiff quite complicated.
